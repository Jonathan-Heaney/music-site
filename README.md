# music-site

Personal music website

## Learned

- I practiced what I wanted to practice on this project.
  - Created a project that uses webpack
  - Exported/imported functions for a modular approach to design
  - Linked CSS files through webpack loaders
  - Rendered a webpage without writing HTML, only using JS and CSS
  - Created a multi-page functionality by hiding different components (which I think will be easier with React)
